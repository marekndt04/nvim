⚠️ Personal Config Notice
This is my personal modified version of the Lua configuration for NvChad.
It builds on the official NvChad setup, but includes custom changes tailored to my preferences.

About

This repo is based on the default NvChad user config setup.

The main NvChad repo (NvChad/NvChad) is used as a plugin by this repo.

You import its modules like require "nvchad.options" or require "nvchad.mappings".

If you clone this locally, you can delete the .git folder or fork it to start your own custom version.
